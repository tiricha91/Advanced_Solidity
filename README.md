## Once a crowdsale has been deployed, a participant can mint new coins in order to purchase the new crypto currency by providing their wallet address and the amount the would like to purchase. 

## The token parameter are the name, symbol and the supply. My contract deployement had a token called Richcoin with the symbol of RC and it was capped at 100,000 coins.
